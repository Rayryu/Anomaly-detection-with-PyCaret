# Ensemble Modeling for Anomaly Detection
This repository showcases a walkthrough for anomaly detection using PyCaret for anomaly detection, generating profiling reports using Pandas Profiling, implementing ensemble modeling with majority voting, and validating results using anomaly scores and visual inspection techniques with Seaborn.
## Notebook Highlights

- Loading and exploring the dataset

- Generating a comprehensive profiling report using Pandas Profiling for in-depth dataset analysis

- Training and evaluating multiple anomaly detection models with PyCaret

- Implementing ensemble modeling using majority voting for improved detection performance

- Validating the results using anomaly scores

- Visual inspection of anomalies using Seaborn for enhanced data exploration
